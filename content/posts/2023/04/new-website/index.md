Welcome to my new website!

It was time for a fresh start. I had built the old website with Create React App, and it seems like the React world is starting to move on. It also had some usability problems:

- There was no blog CMS, so every page had to be built and formatted by hand. This gets tedious fast!
- It lacked rich previews when sharing links on social media.
- It had a complex dependency graph. Keeping the dependencies up to date was a lot of work, and if you fall behind it's extremely difficult to catch back up.

The new website will hopefully address these issues. It's built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) using the [Congo](https://github.com/jpanther/congo) theme. I've found recently that I really enjoy using Go--it's so fast!--so Hugo seemed like a natural fit when I was looking for a new website framework. So far, though, building this website hasn't required touching Go code at all. That may change as I get deeper into the weeds of customization. In the meantime, I love that I can write blog posts in Markdown and have them neatly organized by date and Hugo compiles the entire website in less than a second.

This site is a bit light on content for now, but over the coming weeks I'll port over some old project pages and post updates on some new side projects. I hope you'll come along for the ride!
